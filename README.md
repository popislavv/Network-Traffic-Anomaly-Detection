# Network-Traffic-Anomaly-Detection
Network traffic is a critical point in the modern digital environment. With ubiquitous device connectivity, network security is becoming an essential element of preserving system integrity.
The goal of this research is the implementation of a network traffic anomaly detection system using deep learning. The focus is on the use of the TensorFlow library and the analysis of the factors that influence the detection accuracy.
The work relies on the construction of an artificial neural network, evaluation of model performance on a test data set, analysis of factors that affect accuracy, and experimentation with parameters to achieve better results.
